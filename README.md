# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Random Forest

This project is a web-based breast cancer prediction tool that uses a **Random Forest classifier** to determine whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on 30 numeric features extracted from breast mass data. 

It uses **Flask** as the backend framework, with HTML/CSS for UI rendering and includes a **Pickaxe chatbot** for interactive user help.
